## Solution:

On this challenge, I was provided with a ```.pcap``` file which contained packets form an internal network. My first step in every pcap file is to lunch ```Network Miner``` tool and take a look at what it retrieves. Here I discovered the following files:

Because ```Network Miner``` is a good tool, but not perfect, I had to launch ```Wireshark``` and extract all the files sent by ```10.0.0.6``` host over SMB protocol.

Output of the Wireshark file retrieval:

At this point, I discovered that all files are of ```.jpg``` extension but contain only one character. Let's read them all at once! 

As you can see in the following image, I got on first row a string which looks like a base64 encoding:

I decided to decode my string, and I obtained the following Morse code:

I decoded my Morse code and obtained the flag:

Added the missing parts from the flag in order to respect the format.
